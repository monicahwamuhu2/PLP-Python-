# Basic Calculator Program

This is a simple Python program that allows the user to perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) interactively. The program asks for two numbers and an operation, then computes and displays the result based on the user's input.

## Features

- **Addition**: Adds two numbers.
- **Subtraction**: Subtracts the second number from the first.
- **Multiplication**: Multiplies two numbers.
- **Division**: Divides the first number by the second (with a check for division by zero).

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine or copy the code into your Python environment.
2. Run the Python script.
3. The program will prompt you to input:
   - The first number.
   - The second number.
   - The operation (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`).
4. The program will perform the requested operation and print the result.

### Example Input and Output

## Error Handling

- **Division by Zero**: If the user tries to divide by zero, the program will display an error message: `Error! Division by zero is not allowed.`
- **Invalid Operation**: If the user enters an invalid operation, the program will display: `Invalid operation! Please enter one of the following: +, -, *, /.`
